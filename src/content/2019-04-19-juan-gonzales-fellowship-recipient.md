The NAHJ Bay Area chapter in conjunction with the staff of El Tecolote, would like to congratulate Jacqueline Pinedo as the 2019 Juan Gonzales Fellow. 

Pinedo is the inaugural Juan Gonzales Fellow and will start the 12-week paid fellowship at Acción Latina, publisher of El Tecolote, this summer. 

The first of what NAHJ Bay Area and El Tecolote hope will be many in the years to come, Pinedo was selected from a crop of talented applicants from across Northern California.

She is currently a senior journalism major at San Francisco State University, served as a reporter on SF State’s student-run newspaper; the Golden Gate Xpress and studied abroad in Denmark, producing a variety of stories and multimedia for the Danish School of Media and Journalism. 

El Tecolote is a bilingual news organization that was founded in 1970 by NAHJ Hall of Famer Juan Gonzales. It publishes in both English and Spanish daily online and biweekly in print and it’s the longest running bilingual newspaper in California. Located in the historic Mission District of San Francisco, the organization is dedicated to covering stories and issues often ignored by mainstream media.

¡Felicidades Jacqueline! 

We look forward to your work at El Tecolote.
