NAHJ Bay Area is proud to present the Juan Gonzales Fellowship, a 12-week paid summer fellowship at Accion Latina, Publisher of El Tecolote Newspaper. The selected fellow will receive a stipend of $4,800 over the course of the fellowship. 

The deadline for the 2019 application is March 24, 2019. Apply [here](https://nahjbayarea.com/fellowship).

We invite all current undergraduate/graduate journalism students or recent graduates in or pursuing a journalism career in – but not limited to –  writing, photography, video, audio or web/print design.

The fellowship is named after Juan Gonzales, the founder of El Tecolote Newspaper and a 2009 NAHJ Hall of Fame Honoree.

The Juan Gonzales Fellowship supports diverse journalists who are deeply interested in reporting the most urgent issues the Latino community faces, issues we believe lie at the core of improving the quality of news and information reaching the public.

The fellow is to start in June 2019.
